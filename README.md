Inductive Triple Graphs in Scala

Triple graphs are an inductive representation of graphs based on Martin Erwig's Functional Graph representation.
 Triple graphs are more suitable to represent RDF graphs where edges can be nodes.
 However, triple graphs can be general enough to be used in other contexts. 

We have also added "quad"-graphs which can also be used to represent Named Graphs.
